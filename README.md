This Tableau HR analytics project focused on tackling a pressing issue within the organization. Recently, they've observed a concerning increase in employee turnover, prompting the HR department to delve deeper into understanding its root causes. 

To address this challenge, I've developed a comprehensive dashboard that highlights three pivotal factors: demographics, employee backgrounds, and departmental insights. Exploring how these insights can illuminate the areas most affected by attrition and inform strategic interventions.

The analysis reveals that younger male employees with backgrounds in Life Sciences, particularly those within the R&D department, are significant contributors to the attrition rates. To address this issue, the HR department can implement targeted interventions and strategies. These may involve investing in employee development initiatives, promoting a healthier work-life balance, and ensuring competitive compensation and benefits packages. By tailoring their efforts to the specific needs and challenges of these demographic groups, we can effectively mitigate turnover and foster a more engaged and satisfied workforce.
